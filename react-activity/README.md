## Install

React, ReactDOM are peer dependencies, if you haven't already installed them use:

```

## Getting Started

Import the activity indicators you would like to use along with its corresponding css file.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

import { Dots } from "react-activity";
import "react-activity/dist/Dots.css";

const App = () => {
  return <Dots />;
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById("app-container"));
```

## Optimizing Your Build

To avoid bundling unnecessary code and css to your project, you can import the
activity indicators individually.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

import Dots from "react-activity/dist/Dots";
import "react-activity/dist/Dots.css";

const App = () => {
  return <Dots />;
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById("app-container"));
```
